Description: This package implements methods to estimate and test many
    effects in many conditions (or many effects on many outcomes). The
    methods use Empirical Bayes methods to estimate patterns of
    similarity of effects among conditions, and then exploit those
    patterns of similarity among conditions to improve accuracy of
    effect estimates.

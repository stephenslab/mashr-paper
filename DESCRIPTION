Title: Multivariate adaptive shrinkage package for estimating multiple effects in multiple conditions
Version: 0.1
Date: 2016-12-16
Authors: Sarah Urbut <sarahmurbut@gmail.com>
Description: This package implements methods to estimate and test many effects in many conditions 
(or many effects on many outcomes). The methods use Empirical Bayes methods to estimate patterns of similarity of
effects among conditions, and then exploit those patterns of similarity among conditions to improve accuracy of effect 
estimates.
